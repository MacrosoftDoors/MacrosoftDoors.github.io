    <h1>World's Biggest Food Nerd </h1>
    <p>I'm Jack and there is nothing in this world that compares to food. 
        <br> The universal need that all humans share to nourish themselves is a struggle that affects us all. 
        <br>A need only secondary to the oxygen we breath. For a guy like me, food is a shiny beacon in a colorless world other than anime. 
        <br>Unless we are talking about anime food which is truly gold other than the fact I can't eat it, only fuel for my dreams and is basically porn. 
        <br> I go to sleep every night with an anime food pic in one hand and my idol Gordon Ramsay in the other.</p>

    <p>This is where I collect the recipes I have tried and enjoyed.</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Beginner Cook</h3>
            <p>Some stuff here for getting started. A lot of these are things like stir fries. Remember, you can stir fry anything. 
                <br>I also have a lot of my future wife's crockpot shit. Most of that is a lost cause, but I keep the crockpot because that beef stew is bomb.</p>

                <h3>Intermediate Cook</h3>
                <p>Little bit harder stuff to cook. I pretty much only cook things in this level of difficulty. 
                    <br>It is difficult enough that no matter the quality I can convince myself it is fine dining yet not so difficult I feel like I'm wasting my life.</p>

                <div class="course-col">
                    <h3>Advanced Cook</h3>
                    <p>These are pretty involved or complicated recipes. Only for the brave. 
                        <br> These are the recipes you collect at 3 am when you are supposed to be asleep. You convince yourself you will cook them next week and then years go by.
                        <br>I pretty much only bust these out when I'm trying to impress someone and show them how different our cooking power levels are.
                        <br>Compared to me, most people are Krillen.

        <br>Still I'm pretty proud of my food photo-fu and think my skills are coming along.
        <br>If I make money off this site maybe I can afford a real camera.

    <h1>Proud Moments.</h1>
    <p>This section is just to show you how sexy my food is.
        <br>None of that processed nasty bullshit that pollutes your body. My food looks sexy and will make your body sexy without trying.
        <br>Even if it doesn't, you can console yourself by looking at how sexy this food looks. Truly a sight to behold. 
        <br>I get 10 marriage proposals a week, from men and women. 
        <br>You can learn my secrets here with my "Stray Cat" strategy that outlines how to find 
        <br>quality mates who are good at everything else but can't cook.
        <br>They have to be okay with your food love though so get my second book, "Are they Jealous of my Cheese".
        <br>I also have, "Spoiled Milk, Spoiled Wife" for people wondering what to do with a spouse who doesn't support the foodie lifestyle.

             He has ruined me. I'll never be satisfied by a man's noodle ever again!! He said his food was better than an orgasm, that should have been a warning.</p>

        <p>I met Jack at the bowling alley. Next thing I knew bowling balls turned into bacon wraps. 
            My wife tried to recreate the culinary delight, we are getting a divorce. I deserve better.
            Thank you, Jack. You changed my life.</p>
